Joanna and I worked on today's Kata. 
I drove and Joanna navigated. 
We used the split function to split the string into two strings on an empty space. 
Creating two new variables, name1 and name2, we used the first string and second string, using the substring function, we picked the first letter off of each string and used the toUpperCase function in case the user input is lowercase. This way we still get the results in uppercase for first and last name.
