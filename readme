Sean and I pseudocoded for about 10 minutes on March 15th. 
Sean found a solution this morning in about 5 minutes and we went through it together a couple of times to talk it out and discuss how it works. 
New concepts for me that I learned are using exclusive truthy/falsy, charAt, and modules to get even/odd numbers.
